                Choosing Information Technology was the right choice for me when
                i started university in Finland. I learned most of the basic and
                foundation in software development from my school and I got a
                chance to develop out my skills with many subjects.

              <p>
                Aside from University, I also undertook an intense training
                course at Cybersoft Academy where I learned the advanced concept
                and got a profound understanding of this industry. Additionally,
                for the last 6 months, I have had some experience working with a
                two start-up companies as an exam to graduate from this
                Academy.

                I got a chance to have an internship in Germany thanks to the
                Erasmus program at my University. During 4 months here, I have
                learn about a wide range of skills and knowledge related to
                UX/UI development. I have gained a valuable experience with
                various UX/UI designing tools and technologies used in the

                At the beginning of 2024, I had a chance to work as a front-end developer
                at Justice4.0, a start-up company based in Helsinki, Finland. Here is where 
                I learn to work with different people on building the Jutice Lady application. 
                My tasks were using React and Typescript to build dynamic user interfaces and
                solve different technical issues.

                After graduation, I also had another opportunity at Kraftvaerk, a digital service company,
                where I learned to become a proficient developer. As a Frontend Developer, my main tasks involve implementing UI components 
                and interfaces using React and NextJS, integrating CMS platforms like Optimizely to modify and deliver dynamic content, and
                optimizing web performance.  I have also played a part in collaborating with the stakeholders, using cloud services like 
                Azure and AWS, to translate customerâ€™s requirements into scalable and maintainable web applications.
